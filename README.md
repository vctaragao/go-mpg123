Prelog
------------
_This library is an expand version of the https://github.com/bobertlo/go-mpg123_

Addition to this library:
- Support for [libout123](https://www.mpg123.de/api/group__out123__api.shtml) to audio encode and playback

Introduction
------------
go-mpg123 is a library that provides bindings to libmpg123.

Not all library functions are present, but there are enough bindings to
decode an MP3 file using mpg123_open and mpg123_read. However, decoding
from a file reader and feeding data directly to the decoder are not yet
supported. Seeking and meta-data reading are also not yet supported.

This library is still very much a work in progress.

Usage
-----

The mpg123 library is accessed via a Decoder struct containing a C pointer
to an instance of the library. To decode a file, first create an instance of the decoder,
then tell it to open the file.

	decoder, err := mpg123.NewDecoder("")
	err = decoder.Open("test.mp3")

At this point you should have the decoder peek into the file and find
the format it is encoded in. You may also want to lock this format in
as it may change later if you do not do so.

	rate, channels, encoding := decoder.GetFormat()
	// clear list of formats and only allow the current settings
	decoder.FormatNone()
	decoder.Format(rate, channels, encoding)

Now you are ready to start decoding the file. Simply create a buffer 
and read data into it. Note that there may still be data in the buffer
when EOF is returned, so check for errors after processing the buffer.

	buf := make([]byte, 1024*16)
	for {
		len, err := decoder.Read(buf)
		// do something with the PCM data
		if err != nil {
			break
		}
	}

Examples
--------
### mp3dump.
This program decodesan MP3 file and writes the raw PCM data to a file.

	go get github.com/bobertlo/go-mpg123/examples/mp3dump
	mp3dump <file.mp3> <outfile.raw>

This raw audio file may be played using mplayer:

	mplayer -demuxer rawaudio -rawaudio rate=<samplerate>:channels=<channels> out.raw
 
### play from file
This program decodes an MP3 file and plays it using the default playout device 

	go get github.com/bobertlo/go-mpg123/examples/play_from_file
	mp3play <file.mp3>
